# CoastGuard

To run this code! 

1. Download MongoDB to your local system
2. Make sure you download all the required libraries both client and server
3. Run both client and server through terminal

E voila ! 

<sub> This won't work in reality, as the system relies on real Coastguard cases and a gmail account with those emails, it also uses my api keys which are linked to my bank :worried: </sub>
